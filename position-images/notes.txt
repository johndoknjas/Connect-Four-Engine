In 1.png, yellow is to move, and one of red's goals is to create a winning threat on F4 (an odd square, which red wants).
If yellow plays to G4, red could go to G5, creating the threat. If yellow does nothing, then red could go to G4 and create the threat anyway 
(although in this example yellow could then go to G5 and create a threat right below, but assume this isn't the case).

So, since the square F4 (amplifies multiple 2-in-a-rows) counts as a number of amplifying squares, it has next_squares stacked on each other: G3, G4, G5.
So, squares like F4 should generally be worth more, since the opponent can't stop them from becoming a stronger threat.

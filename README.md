You can play Connect Four against this engine. So far for this version, its ratio against me in games is somewhere between 4 and 5. I calculate the ratio with: (num_computer_wins + num_draws * 0.5) / (num_my_wins + num_draws * 0.5); note that I don't record scores for games beginning at the empty starting position, since this wouldn't be fair to the computer in the long run (I can learn and get better from this one position after each game but the computer won't).

This is a nice improvement from the engine back in January 2019, when the ratio was between 3 and 4. Although the higher ratio now may be in part due to fairer starting positions, since the DB is used to pick fair positions to play. By minimizing the number of potentially lopsided starting positions, the engine's superiority is reflected more in the score.

For positions at and below 9 ply, the engine may communicate with a DB (via SQLite) to evaluate them and find a good move. This DB was generated by a previous version of the engine (V.41) that thought on each reachable 9 ply position, and then these results were used to generate data for all 0 to 8 ply positions as well.

The file was too large to upload to Github, but it can be downloaded here:

After downloading, copy this DB file to some directory on your computer.

Also, please install sqlite3, if it's not on your computer. The program uses the splite3 C/C++ API to interface with the database.

After doing this, you can run a.exe directly, if you just want to play against the engine in the raw C++ ASCI interface. It's also possible to
compile the C++ source code yourself. To do this, type the following in the terminal: g++ main.cpp -O2 -l sqlite3. This will generate a new a.exe file.

If you'd prefer to play using a Python GUI I built, go inside the python-gui directory and open the command prompt. If you don't have pyinstaller, 
install it with "pip install pyinstaller". Then type "pyinstaller interface.py" - we're only interested in the dist/interface directory that gets created.
Copy the following files from /python-gui, and paste them into /python-gui/dist/interface: directory.txt, error_effect.wav, move_effect.wav, OngoingScore.txt, 
second_move_effect.wav, and signal.txt. Also, go back into the /Connect Four directory, and copy the a.exe file into /python-gui/dist/interface as well.

Then in /python-gui/dist/interface, open up the directory.txt file. Replace the line in it with the absolute path of where you downloaded the database onto your computer.
 
Finally, run interface.exe.

For 1.png, the engine was playing the yellow pieces, and it moved to C3, allowing C4. We ended up drawing this game.

For 2.png, the engine was playing the yellow pieces, and it moved to E3, allowing me to play E4 (and I'm the one who benefits
more from odd squares). In addition, it then spent a very long time thinking (likely 20+ seconds), before playing A4. I won this game.

Both of these cases involve the engine allowing its opponent to create a threat on D3, and when odd squares benefit the opponent.
I think this has been an occasional issue with previous versions of the engine as well.

3.png isn't a questionable move, but I might have played the starting position with the engine before? Not sure. The starting position
was the position without the moves F2 and C3, and it was me to move (playing the yellow pieces).
   - Also, even though only 80 possible starting sets of moves are picked on each run of the application, they are a random set of
     80 on every run. So getting the same 5-ply position twice (in under 30 games) should be unlikely.

For 1.png, the engine was playing the yellow pieces, and it moved to C3, allowing C4. We ended up drawing this game.

For 2.png, the engine was playing the yellow pieces, and it moved to E3, allowing me to play E4 (and I'm the one who benefits
more from odd squares). In addition, it then spent a very long time thinking (likely 20+ seconds), before playing A4. I won this game.

Both of these cases involve the engine allowing its opponent to create a threat on D3, and when odd squares benefit the opponent.
I think this has been an occasional issue with previous versions of the engine as well.
   - **Update**: The changes made in V.54 might fix this issue, at least to some degree. The engine now more highly values threats on D3
     for the player favouring odds.

3.png isn't a questionable move, but I might have played the starting position with the engine before? Not sure. The starting position
was the position without the moves F2 and C3, and it was me to move (playing the yellow pieces).
   - *Update*: It turns out the same set of 80 possible starting positions was chosen on each run of the program. Because of this, it's
     plausible that I could have played the same position with the engine multiple times.
   - This issue has been fixed, so playing the same position with the engine is quite unlikely now (at least within a small sample of 30 games).

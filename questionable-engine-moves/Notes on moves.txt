For 1.png, the engine was playing the yellow pieces, and it moved to C3, allowing C4. We ended up drawing this game.

For 2.png, the engine was playing the yellow pieces, and it moved to E3, allowing me to play E4 (and I'm the one who benefits
more from odd squares). In addition, it then spent a very long time thinking (likely 20+ seconds), before playing A4. I won this game.

Both of these cases involve the engine allowing its opponent to create a threat on D3, and when odd squares benefit the opponent.
I think this has been an occasional issue with previous versions of the engine as well.
